            I&#39;m Amie Morales, a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer
            based in Austin, Texas. My journey in tech is driven by an
            insatiable curiosity and a love for problem-solving. I thrive on
            challenges and continuously push myself to learn and grow in this
            ever-evolving field.

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            My path to software engineering has been marked by intense
            dedication and rapid growth. After completing a rigorous Software
            Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, I dove headfirst
            into the startup world. As the sole developer at CentralTexas.com
            during its Techstars accelerator program, and later as a co-founder
            and Software Engineer at Eazl.ai, I&#39;ve gained invaluable
            experience in building and scaling applications from the ground up.

            I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems.
            Whether it&#39;s automating processes, integrating AI to enhance
            user experiences, or building robust and scalable applications,
            I&#39;m always looking for ways to create value through code. I
            approach each project with a blend of creativity and analytical
            thinking, ensuring that the solutions I develop are not just
            functional, but innovative and efficient.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            At Eazl.ai, I single-handedly built and maintained a prompt
            management app, integrating cutting-edge AI models, developing
            custom APIs, and implementing complex features like subscription
            logic and an AI cost estimator. This experience taught me that
            there&#39;s always a solution to any challenge â€“ it&#39;s just a
            matter of finding the right approach.

          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Outside of coding, I&#39;m a creative soul with a passion for music,
            photography, and outdoor adventures. I enjoy capturing moments
            through my lens, exploring new hiking trails, and diving into the
            world of music production. My diverse interests fuel my creativity
            and provide a well-rounded perspective that I bring into my work.
