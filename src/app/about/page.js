              I&#39;m Amie Morales, a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer
              based in Austin, Texas. My journey in tech is driven by an
              insatiable curiosity and a love for problem-solving. I thrive on
              challenges and continuously push myself to learn and grow in this

              My path to software engineering has been marked by intense
              dedication and rapid growth. After completing a rigorous Software
              Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly, I dove
              headfirst into the startup world. As the sole developer at
              CentralTexas.com during its Techstars accelerator program, and
              later as a co-founder and Software Engineer at Eazl.ai, I&#39;ve
              gained invaluable experience in building and scaling applications
              from the ground up.

              I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems.
              Whether it&#39;s automating processes, integrating AI to enhance
              user experiences, or building robust and scalable applications,
              I&#39;m always looking for ways to create value through code. I
              approach each project with a blend of creativity and analytical
              thinking, ensuring that the solutions I develop are not just
              functional, but innovative and efficient.

              At Eazl.ai, I single-handedly built and maintained a prompt

              custom APIs, and implementing complex features like subscription
              logic and an AI cost estimator. This experience taught me that
              there&#39;s always a solution to any challenge â€“ it&#39;s just a
              matter of finding the right approach.
